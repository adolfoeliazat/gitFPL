## fplAnalytics
This repo hosts my hobbiest website/blog www.fplanalytics.com, which is about data analysis and visualizations using official APIs of Fantasy Premier League (https://fantasy.premierleague.com/). Please note, currently all the files which build the website (HTML,CSS,Javascritps,Json etc) reside in gh-pages. At later stage I plan to put my source codes in the main repo which are so far in R and Python (but could be anything else during further development).


## Intorduction

www.fplanalytics.com is a website for the lovers of the Fantasy Premier League (https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) - a fantasy football game based on English Premier League. It uses the official APIs from the site for data inputs and processes them for fantasy managers to analyze for greater insights. Other than daily updates of price rise/fall and injuries/suspensions/fitness of the players. There are many data tables, charts and visualizations to help the fantasy managers to make a better picks based on info and stats.

## Examples




## Note

* The scripts files are not here yet, so far the repo is only used to host HTML/Javascripts contents.
* Plans to put the scripts (R, Python) used for automatic generation of web files at later 
* Currently working slowly on a new look (mobile friendly) website, hopefully ready before next season (Work in Progress: https://gpoudel.github.io/gitFPL/fplanalytics/index.html).
